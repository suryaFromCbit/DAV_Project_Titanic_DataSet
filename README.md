# Titanic Survival Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the **Titanic Survival Dataset** using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques. The objective is to identify key factors that influenced passenger survival rates. The dataset includes information such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and family relations.

## 📊 Key Features of the Analysis
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Handled missing values
  - Converted categorical variables to numerical format
  - Removed unnecessary columns
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Survival rate by **passenger class**
  - Impact of **gender** on survival
  - **Age distribution** of survivors vs. non-survivors
  - Influence of **embarkation port**
  - Relationship between **family size** and survival
  - **Fare distribution** and its correlation with survival
  - **Deck (Cabin feature) analysis**
- **Visualizations:**
  - Count plots, histograms, bar charts, box plots, and heatmaps

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** (Data handling)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**

## 📂 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-eda.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Colab file to explore the analysis.

## 📑 Results & Insights
- **Women had a significantly higher survival rate** compared to men.
- **First-class passengers had a better survival chance** than second and third-class passengers.
- **Higher ticket fares were associated with a higher probability of survival.**
- **Passengers who embarked from 'C' (Cherbourg) had a higher survival rate** than those from other ports.
